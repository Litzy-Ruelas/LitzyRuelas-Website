        <p class="lead mb-4">Throughout high school I have volunteered in many different programs in order to help others such as food drives or coaching, this is because I am passionate about helping others, and this is what has led me into wanting to attain a career in healthcare. Although my need to help others didn’t begin in high school, since a very young age I have been passionate about helping others whether it will be doing simple tasks or caring for others. As I grew I realized that I would love to specialize in the healthcare field but, it wasn’t until later that I realized it would be as a pediatrician. My love for children and helping others was always present, I loved babysitting and cuddling my siblings, cousins, and babies in general, therefore, specializing in children seemed natural to me. My family and parents are very supportive of my choice and want me to succeed. In middle school, the school offered a program where we were taught doctors and visited their work environment in hospitals. The doctors talk about their career paths and their professions, while also encouraging us in continuing into following our dreams no matter what others may say. He brought up how many may have stated “becoming a doctor takes too long” or “is too hard” but he assured us that it would be all worth it.
<br><br>

        Through the years I have focused on my studies and participated in some volunteer work. But, as I began college I also began to work and through my work experience, I was able to understand the importance of scheduling, work strategy, and bigger responsibilities. I was a bit more challenged with school and work but, with a good schedule, it was possible. Yet, although I tried my best to be well scheduled and time focused there were times when I felt overwhelmed with too much work and studying as well as work. During these times I try not to get into my head and focus on my tasks day by day. This encourages me to be more productive and have a positive look towards my work. Getting too much stress and work can lead me to be negative about my goal and want to give up.
<br><br>

        As an upcoming Pediatrician, I will have completed my required studies and internships to qualify for the position. I will specialize in caring for babies, children, and teens as well as communicating with parents.  I am aware of the needs of children and how they may differ from adults and how to deal with them. I will focus on preventing and identifying any illnesses within the child and If the child seems to be in need of immediate medical attention I am more than qualified to perform what is required of me. If the child comes in for a regular visit I am aware of what must be done to ensure the child is in a healthy state. I hope to be a great pediatrician with an excellent work ethic.
